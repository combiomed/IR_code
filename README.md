## Chromatin accessibility determines intron retention in a cell type-specific manner

### Summary
Dynamic intron retention (IR) in vertebrate cells is of widespread biological importance. Aberrant IR is associated with numerous human diseases including cancer.  Despite consistent reports demonstrating intrinsic sequence features that predispose introns to become retained, conflicting findings about cell type-specific IR regulation demand a systematic analysis in a controlled experimental setting. We integrated matched transcriptomics and epigenetics data (including DNA methylation, nucleosome occupancy, histone modifications) from primary human myeloid and lymphoid cells. Using machine learning we trained two complementary models to determine the role of epigenetic factors in the regulation of IR. We show that increased chromatin accessibility contributes substantially to the retention of introns in a cell-specific manner. We also confirm that intrinsic characteristics of introns are key for them to evade splicing. With mounting reports linking pathogenic alterations to RNA processing, our findings may have profound implications for the design of therapeutic approaches targeting aberrant splicing.
